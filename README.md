# Responsive Webpage Project

This project was developed as part of an internship. The goal was to create a responsive webpage that displays a quote attributed to Steve Jobs along with some information about him. The project utilizes HTML and CSS to structure the content and style it, respectively. The webpage layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

## Live Demo

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling rules for the webpage.
- `images/`: A directory containing any images used in the project.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The webpage layout adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent and pleasant user experience across devices.
- Author Information: Displayed with an Apple icon, name, and date of the quote.
- Typography: The 'Manrope' font from Google Fonts is used for a modern and clean appearance.

## Media Queries

Media queries have been used to make the webpage responsive:

- On screens with a maximum width of 750px, the layout changes to a column format, and certain styles are adjusted accordingly.
